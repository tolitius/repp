# Repp
**R**ead **E**valuate **P**rint **P**rofit

Repp stands on the shoulders of [zxing](https://code.google.com/p/zxing/) and [tesseract-ocr](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

While there are native mobile apps that provide barcode scanning and/or OCR, 
Repp is a web app hence is not tied to any particular mobile OS and can be used by both: 
mobile and anything else that has a browser (i.e. potentially be a service).

## Repp in Action

Since "tesseract-ocr" is platform dependent, it needs to be [installed](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/wiki/Compiling) 
so Repp can call into it.

Running Repp can be as simple as:
```bash
lein ring server
```
